        <h1><p>My Work At the Museum of Life and Science</p></h1>
            <p><a href="http://www.lifeandscience.org">The Museum of Life and Science</a> is located in Durham, North Carolina. 
            My work at the museum is varied; I lead programs focused in several different fields of science, but 
            primarily, my program focuses are paleontology and zoology. <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_yLtymaLkg&list=PLG6jdnvfDkn4gbp_IBUefMnAVV-rOXRnN&index=15&t=668s">Here's a link</a> to a video of me leading a 
            virtual program on dinosaurs!</p>

            <p>In addition to leading programs,
                I also manage the <a href ="http://www.lifeandscience.org/birthdays">birthday party programs</a> at the museum.</p>

            <p>I also serve as the <a href ="http://www.keeperblog.org/2020/03/super-mandy/">program 
                animal trainer</a> at the museum. This means that I'm responsible for training all museum 
                staff that handle animals. Here's a few pictures of me with a few of my animal friends!</p>

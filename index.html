        <h1 id="main-title"><strong>Mandy Koch</strong></h1>
        <h2 class="section-headings"><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
        <p>I am currently a first-year graduate student in the Learning 
        Design and Technology program. I am a program educator 
        at the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, N.C. and am
        passionate about informal education, specifically in the museum field.
        In my free time, I like to listen to true crime podcasts, go on long walks, and explore new TV shows to binge.</p>

        <h2 class="section-headings">My Favorite EdTech Tools</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><h3 class="paragraph-headings">GSuite</h3><p>At the museum, we use Google Suites to communicate with our 
                    homeschool families. Children in our homeschool programs come to the museum
                     2 days a week to engage in museum programming and experience facilitated
                      exhibit tours. As educators, we post daily reports on GSuite complete 
                      with pictures of the day's events, as well as supplemental activities 
                      that the children can do at home.</p></li>
                
                <li><h3 class="paragraph-headings">SeeSaw</h3><p>Since a large majority of children had to transition to virtual school due to COVID,
                    the museum started a program called Museum Clubhouse. Children in this program come
                    to the museum 2, 3, or 4 days a week to complete their virtual school assignemnts, but also
                    engage in museum programs and activities. I have been working with this program for 2 months now,
                    and have seen numerous students using the SeeSaw app, which allows teachers to 
                    provide interactive assignments of various types (matching games, listening activities,
                    writing exercises) to their students.</p></li>
               

                <li><h3 class="paragraph-headings">Trello</h3><p>Trello is not so much an educational technology tool, as it is a project
                    management tool. We use it all the time at the museum, in order to complete 
                    projects across the entire team in an organized, timely manner. Trello is incredibly
                    user-friendly, and allows for teams to track progress on projects and 
                    assign tasks to individual team-members.</p></li>
